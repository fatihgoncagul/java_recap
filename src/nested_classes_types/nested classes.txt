Nesting classes (or types) within another class (or type)

A class can contain other types within the class body, such as other classes
interfaces, enums and records

These are called nested types or nested classes

You might want to use nested classes when your classes are tightly coupled, meaning their
functionality is interwoven (iç içe geçmiş)

THE FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF NESTED CLASSEES:
static nested class : declared in class body, like a static field, acces to this class is through the class name identifier
instance or inner class: declared in class body, this type of class can only be accessed through and instance of the outer class
local class: declared within a method body
anonymous class: unnamed class, declared and instantiated in statement

Before jdk16 only static nested classes were allowed to have static methods
As of jdk16 all four types of nested classes can have static members of any type
including static methods
