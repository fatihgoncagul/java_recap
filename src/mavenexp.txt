project management tool
when we are building and using the created application we get use of
MAVEN in order to sync with the dependencies between spirng and hibernate for example
if somerthing changes in hibernate, it might not support the spring version we are using
we need to update that
maven helps this issue
maven helps us to get the dependencies
maven also provides compiling, running, testing, packaging, deploying


for every project, when we add dependencies to pom.xml
we ask Maven to download those from internet
it searches on our machine first, its in the C:\Users\<UserName>\.m2\repository
if there is not
it downloads from Maven Central and copies to our computer

but theres a problem, do you think all the repositories are safe?
so we need to make sure that we are using repositories that are safe
in intellij it gives us information if its vulnerable
also in mvn-repository also gives info

in companies, theres company repository which is well tested on security
maven would look local machine first  then looks company repo, if not there it wont go to the mavencentral
but you can contact with the security team etc

// important thing about database connection
if we use postre then we might want to change it to mysql
so we will change so many lines
but dbms provide actual implementation that makes it easier
