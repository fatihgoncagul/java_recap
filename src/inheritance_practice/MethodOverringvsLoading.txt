Method overloading means providing two or more seperate methods, in a class,
with the same name, but different parameters
Method return type may or may not be different, and that allows us to reuse the same method name
Overloading reduces duplicated code and we don't have to remember multiple method names
compiler is determining the right method to call on argument list
---------
Method overriding means defining a method in a child class, that already exists in the
parent class, with the same signature (the same name,same arguments)
We cannot override static methods, only instance methods can be overridden
a rule would be: it cannot have a lower acces modifier. it cant have more restrictive access
final or private methods cannot be overridden
subclass can use super.METHODNAME() to call the superclass version of an overridden method
