Enumeration
the enum type is java's type to support something called enumeration
a complete ordered listing of all the items in a collection
a special data type that contains predefined constants
a constant is a variable whose value can't be changed, once it's value has been assigned
*so an enum is a little like an array, except its elements are known, not changeable
and each element can be referred by a constant name, instead of an index position
