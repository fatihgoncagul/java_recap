INTERFACES

An interface lets us treat an instance of a single class an many different types

We saw that an abstract class requires its subclasses to implement its abstract methods

An interface is similar to an abstract class although it is not a class

Its a special type that is more like a contract between the class and client code, that
the compiler enforces

By declaring its using an interface, your class must implement all the abstract
methods on the interface

Aclass agrees to this, because it wants to be known by that type, by the outside world
or the client code

An interface lets classes that might have little else in common, be recognized as a
special reference type

declaring : public interface IFlightEnabled {}

implenmtation: public class Bird implements IFlightEnabled


A class can only extend a single class, which is why java called single inhereitance

***BUT, a class can implement many interfaces. This gives us plug and play functionality
which is what makes them so powerful***


//WE dont have to declare the interface type abstract,
// because this modifier is implicityl declared for all interfaces
// Likewise, we dont have to declare any method abstract
// In fact, any method declared without a body, is really implicitly declared
// both public and abstract

// if we dont write acces modifier on a class member, it's implicity package private
// If we omit an acces modifier on an interface member, it is implicitly public

Changing the acces modifier of a method to protected, on an interface, is a compiler error
whether the method concrete or abstract

Only a concrete method can have private acces

We can see that we can describe birds in many ways, treating it as a
member of multiple and quite different types

remember that on uml diagram abstraction is shown with dashed lines and empty arrow

In interfaces it turns out any field declared on interface are not instance fields
they are implicitly public static and final which means they are really constants

* The final modifier in Java
when we use the final modifier, we prevent any further modifications to that component

a final method means it can't be overriden by a subclass

a final field means an object's field cannot be reassigned or given a different value,
after its initialization

a final static field is a class field that cant be reassigned or given a different value
after the class's initialization process

a final class cannot be overriden meaning that no class can use it in the extends clause

a final variable in a block of code, means that once it's assigned a value
any remaining code in the block cannot change it

a final method parameter means we cannot assign a different value to that parameter in
the method code block

the final static field, is what you are really creating when you declare a field on an interface

A constant in java is a variable that cannot be changed

a constant variable is a final variable of primitive type, or type String that
is initialized with constant expression

constants in java written all UPPERCASE_LETTERS

a static constant means we access it via the type name

we saw this with the INTEGER.MAX_VALUE

interface never gets instantiated and wont have a subclass that gets instantiated either

there is no such thing as instance fields on interface because of this

You might ask is not a Bird an instance of FlightEnabled(INTERFACE)?
no. bird is an instance of a class that implements flightenabled's methods
bird does not inherit traits from flightenabled, it just agrees to behave a certain way

interfaces can be extended using extends keywords

unlike a class interface can use extends keyword with multiple interfaces

an interface does not implement another interface

both interfaces and abstract classes are abstracted reference types

reference types can be used in code as variable types, method parameters, return
types list types so on

when you use an abstracted reference type, this is referred to as coding to an interface

this means u use more generelized types usually an interface type

this technique is preferred cause it allows many runtime instances of various classes
to be processed uniformly by the same code

it also allows for substitutions of some other class or object, that still implements the same interface
without forcing a major refactor of your code

using interface types as the reference type is considered a BEST PRACTICE
for ex
        // we declared arraylist for variable fliers, if wanna change it later to LinkedList it will cause problems
        // we are gonna need to change the methods too!
        // if we use List interface declaration, later we can change arralist to linkedlist etc.

what happens 40 classes using your interface and you wanna add an abstract method into interface?
40 classes wont compile when we add extra method
our code wont be backward compatible with this issu
but java has several changes to interface lets look

the DEFAULT METHOD is a concrete method meaning it has a code block not abstract
we can override this
and this default method does not break any classes currently implementing the interface

***differences between abstract class and interfaces***

we cannot instantiate both of them.

in abstract classes we can declare fields that are not static and final, instance fields in other words

wih abstract classes we can use any of the four access modifiers for its concrete methods

we can also use private for abstract methods of abstact classes

an abstract class can extend only one parent class, but it can implement multiple
interfaces

when an abtract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations
for all of the abstract methods in its parent class

however if it doesnt then the subclass must also be declared abstract

use an abstract class when..
u expect classes that extend your abstract class to have many common methods or fields
or require acces modifiers other than public
u want to declare nonstatic or nonfinal fields so this enables u to define methods
that can access and modify the state of an object (get,setName)
YOU HAVE A REQUIREMENT for your base class, to provide a default implementation of
certain methods, but other methods should be open to being overriden by child classes
Summary: an æbstract class provides common d€fininition as a base class that multiple
derived classes can share

AN INTERFACE is just the declaration of methods which u want some classes
to have its not the implementation

In an interface, we define what kind of operation an object can perform. These
operations defined by the classes that impelement the interface

Interfaces form a contract between the class, and the outside world and this conttract
is enforced at build time, by the java compiler

u cannot instantiate interfaces but they may contain a mix of methods declared with
or without implementation

all methods on interfaces declared without a method body are automatically public and
abstract

an interface can extend another interface

ınterfaces more flexible and can deal with a lot more stress on the design of your
program cause they are not part of the class hierarchy

BY INTRODUCING INTERFACES INTO YOUR PROGRAM YOU ARE REALLY INTRODUCING POINTS OF
VARIATION AT WHICH YOU CAN PLUG IN DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTATIONS FOR THAT INTERFACE

the interface decouples the "what" from the "how" and is used to make different types behave
in similar ways

The keyword default is used mostly for backwards compability

since java 9 an interface can also contain private methods commonly used when
default methods share common code

Use an Interface when...
you expect that unrelated classes will implement your interface. For example
two of java's own interfaces, comparable and cloneable, can be implemented by many
unrelated classes
you want to specify the behavior part of particular data type, but you are not concerned
about who implements its behavior
you want to seperate different behavior

records and enums can implement interface but cannot extend abstract class
