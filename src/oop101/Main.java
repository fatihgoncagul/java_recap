/*
 * Object oriented programming is way to model real world objects
 * as software objects, which contain both data and code
 * objects has state and behaviour
 * state is objects attributes etc
 * behaviour is its actions
 * think of a class as a template or blueprint
 *
 * a class member can be a field or a method or some other type of dependent element
 * if a field is static, there is only one copy in memory, and this value
 * is associated with the class or template itself
 * if a field is not staticc its called an instance field
 * and each object may have a different value stored for this field
 *
 * a static method cant be dependent on any one objects state
 * so it cant reference any instance members
 *
 * in other words, any method that operates
 * on instance fields needs to be nonstatic
 *
