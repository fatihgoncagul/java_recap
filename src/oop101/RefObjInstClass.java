* using blueprint we can build many houuses
* each house is an object
* this object also known as an instance
* each house we build has and address and that is reference
*
* we can copy the reference as many times we like but theres still just one house
* that we are referring to
* in other words we're copyying the papaer that has address on it not the house itself
* we can pass references as parameters to constructors and methods
